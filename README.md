# **Movie Recommendation System** ðŸŽ¬ 

This project implements a movie recommendation system using machine learning techniques, focusing on content-based filtering approach. The system recommends movies based on the features of movies (such as genres, producers, studios, etc.) and the preferences of other users.

## **Key Approaches:** ðŸ“š 

**Content-Based Filtering:**

Recommends movies based on features like genre, producer, studio, and synopsis.

## **Features:** ðŸ›  

**Preprocessing:** Data cleaning and text processing (removing punctuation, stopwords, and tokenization).

**Cosine Similarity:** Used for content-based recommendations by calculating similarity between movie features.

**Word2Vec:** Advanced embedding-based model to calculate movie similarities using word vectors.


## **Libraries Used:** ðŸ“¦

-Pandas, NumPy

-Scikit-learn (CountVectorizer, Cosine Similarity)

-Gensim (Word2Vec)

-NLTK (for text preprocessing
